This project contains scripts and patches to build packages for the [Termux](https://termux.com/) Android application. Note that packages are cross-compiled and on-device builds are not currently supported.

More information can be found in the [docs](docs/) directory.

### Android 7 branch is in alpha testing !

Android 5/6 support will no longer be our priority. We are going to switch to API 24 target to ensure that Android's libc and linker is able to provide features we need.

Old (android 5) branch will continue to be served at https://termux.net and will receive package updates but no new packages will be added.

If you decided to test the new branch and have AArch64 device, follow these steps:

1. `pkg in termux-keyring`

2. Edit `$PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list` and replace the line
    ```
    deb https://termux.net stable main
    ```
    with
    ```
    deb https://dl.bintray.com/termux/termux-packages-24 stable main
    ```

3. Run `pkg up`.

4. Report found issues. Note that issues only for official packages are accepted.

It is highly recommended to try to execute programs without `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` set. Most of them should continue to run since `DT_RUNPATH` field compiled-in ELF binary is used. Though, some programs are not working due to missing `DT_RUNPATH`, please check list in the related issue https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3490 and tell if we missed something.

## Directory Structure

- [disabled-packages](disabled-packages/): Packages that cannot be built or have serious issues.

- [docs](docs/): Documentation on how to build, formatting etc.

- [ndk-patches](ndk-patches/): Patches for Android NDK headers.

- [packages](packages/): All currently available packages.

- [scripts](scripts/): Utility scripts for building.

## Issues

The two most common types of issues are package requests and bug reports. There are already templates available.

You can open an issue for any package or build problems. For example, if you observing crashes or other kind of malfunction, you are certainly welcome to file an issue.

Also, if you want to request a particular package, you may suggest it in an issue. However, be prepared that package may not be available shortly. Bugfixes and improvements take precedence over new packages.

## Pull Requests

We welcome any pull requests. Nevertheless, a log file should be provided in order to show that it is at least working.

Normally, all pull requests will be tested by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/termux/termux-packages). However, in case if you are banned or for whatever reason do no use Travis CI, you should provide a log file by yourself.

All tests for master branch are done by Gitlab CI.
